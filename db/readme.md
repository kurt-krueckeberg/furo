## Umlauts and Character Sets

The specific problem with German umlauts is often described as 'dictionary order' or 'phone-book order'.
The Unicode default is okay for the former but if you want `'Ãœ' = 'UE'`, then you could consider
`utf8mb4_de_pb_0900_ai_ci` or `utf8mb4_german2_ci`, assuming character set is utf8mb4.

## Unknown person

The `person(id)` of **1** designates any as yet unknown individual whose attibutes are all unknown. These values are used:

* `fname` and `lname` are `unknown`
* `fid` and `mid` are `1`
* `badte`, birth date, is `0000-00-00`
* `bplace`, birth place, is `unknown`
