Figure Test
===========

Below is a list-style table that contains figures that could have captions, scaled and have tagets.
Using ``:figwidth: image`` I believe 

.. list-table:: Table title goes here
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Click image to view fullsize 
   * -
       .. figure:: /images/img1.jpg         
          :figclass: image
          :class: with-border
          :figwidth: image 
          :scale: 15 %
 
          Caption for image  

          Legend where I will put description (or transcription).

       .. figure:: /images/img11.jpg         
          :figclass: image
          :class: with-border
          :figwidth: image
          :scale: 25 %
 
          Caption for image  

          Legend where I will put description.
