Figure Test
===========

Below is a list-style table that contains figures that could have captions, scaled and have tagets.
 Using ``:figwidth: iamge`` I believe 

.. list-table:: Table title goes here
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Click on image to view it fullsize it
   * -
       .. figure:: /images/image1.jpg         
          :scale: 15 %
          :figclass: image
          :class: with-border
          :figwidth: image 
 
          Caption for image  

          Legend where I will put description (or transcription).
   
   * - 
       .. figure:: /images/image11.jpg         
          :scale: 25 %
          :figclass: with-border
          :class: with-border
          :figwidth: image
 
          Caption for image  

          Legend where I will put description.
